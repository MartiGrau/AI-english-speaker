# AI-english-speaker :rocket:
Project to develop an AI system to improve English speaking.

We will use different AI models:
- Speech to Text models (STT) for converting audio to text
- LLM models (Language Models) for generating responses
- Text to speech models (TTS) for converting text to audio

## TODO:
#### Research
- [x] Research and Test STT models -> I've found DeepSpeech to be the best option for real-time STT.
- [x] Research and Test TTS models

#### Implementation
- [x] Implement an agent to generate responses from text using LangChain and ChatGPT API
- [x]Â Small Streamlit demo to thest the STT model
- [ ] Interconnect the agent with the STT and TTS models

#### Interface
- [ ] Implement a web interface to interact with the agent -> Streamlit
